# üå∏ Amber ‚Äì Discord Bot

Amber is a private Discord bot built in **Kotlin** with [JDA](https://github.com/discord-jda/JDA) and [jda-ktx](https://github.com/minndevelopment/jda-ktx).  
It is designed to integrate with the [Effect Library API](https://github.com/M64DiamondStar/EffectLibrary-API), providing flows for asset submission, moderation, and approval.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** This repository is public for transparency, but the bot itself is **not intended for public hosting**.  
The project is under MIT license so you can do with it whatever you want, but the bot itself is created to run in a very specific environment so it's pointless to host it yourself in this state.
